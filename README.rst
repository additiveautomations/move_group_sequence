Move Group Sequence
===================

Plan and execute sequences of LIN, PTP and CIRC motions on industrial manipulators.

Based on `pilz_robot_programming <https://github.com/PilzDE/pilz_industrial_motion/tree/melodic-devel/pilz_robot_programming>`_ but adapted to work with any manipulator with a moveit configuration. This requires the `Pilz Industrial Motion Planner <https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/pilz_industrial_motion_planner/pilz_industrial_motion_planner.html>`_ to be installed.
